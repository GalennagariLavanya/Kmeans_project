# Kmeans_project
Project Title: Analysis and prediction of "small_customers.csv"of American mall markets called as phonix small.To find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop.On the basis of this prediction of annual income versus spending scores.
# Disclaimer:
In this particular data sets we assume annual income as a centroid and spending score from the range 1-100 called as data nodes of the cluster.
# Problem Statement:
The American finanace market as per the GDP of 2011 'Phonix_Trillums mall' as in the first range out of 5.The owner of the mall wants to be exact which particular shop or products search in different kinds of clusters in entire mall. As a data science engineer predict the futuristic financial market for upcoming GDP rate based on no of clusters. The client wants at least 5 top clusters(shops).

# conclusion:
According to the model basics prediction using machine learning algorithm KMeans clustering we found that cluster1 which consist red color is a highest cluster which attach more than 50 data nodes
# Reference:
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values.The yellow spots represents centriods which is max to max only 3
